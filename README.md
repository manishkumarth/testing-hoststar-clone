The application uses the [Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movie data. The API requests are handled using the provided GlobalApi.js module. Trending movies and movies by genre can be accessed through the following methods:
```javascript
//GlobalApi.js
import axios from 'axios';
                      
const movieBaseUrl = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3"
const api_key = 'your-api-key'
```
Remember to replace 'your-api-key' with your actual TMDb API key in GlobalApi.js file.
